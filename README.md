# Operation-Wine-and-Dine

"This white goes great...with this red" was the level of sophistication I had during my most recent wine tasting with a group of friends.  Feeling as though it was time to become more cultured, I set out on this project to explore the chemical make up of different red wines to hopefully understand what makes some wines taste better than others.

My goals for this project were the following:
1) Explore the Data Set to get some experience using dplyr and tidyr packages
2) Create Visualizations using ggplot
3) Construct and tune a predictive model to help with wine selection

Cheers!
